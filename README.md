# Distillery of Western Philosophy

This repository contains a number of "distillations" of articles on Western
Philosophy.

The goal is to extract out the main theses of articles and articulate them in
the most plain and terse language possible.

Philosophy articles, especially of the encyclopaedic type, can be written in a
dense and formal style.

These distillations aim to provide more accessibility to ideas that may
otherwise lay beyond any individual's available effort to decipher the original
texts.
