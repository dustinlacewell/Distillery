# Preface

Metaphysics one of the most fundamental areas of philosophy.

In Ancient and Medieval times it regarded questions like:

- "what is being?"
- "what are the first causes?"
- "what things are unchanging?"

In modern times, Metaphysics has taken on much broader scope of problems. What
philosophical questions are Metaphysical questions has changed over time.


# 1. The Word 'Metaphysics' and the Concept of Metaphysics

Meta is a prefix usually meant to point to the ideas surrounding the idea to
which the word is prefixed.

It may be easy to think of Meta-physics, then, to point to ideas that go beyond
"physics", of the like of Newton and Einstein.

However, Metaphysics was first used to name a number of works by Aristotle.

These works pertained to subjects, as he described them, such as "first
philosophy", "first science", "wisdom" and "theology". Hundreds of years later
these books were described as "Aristole's Metaphysics", or in the original
greek "Ta meta phusika" or "the after the physicals".

This naming was likely intended to convey to students that these kinds of
subjects were those that students should refrain from studying until they had
already mastered those books we now called "Aristotle's Physics" which deal
with the less abstract happenings of actually physical phenomena.

During the seventeenth century, the word "Metaphysics" began to become a
catch-all category for philosophical problems that could not otherwise be
classified into other nicely fitting domains of philosophy.

We can now distinguish between two kinds of "Metaphysics", the old and the new.
